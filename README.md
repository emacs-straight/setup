`setup.el`
==========

The `setup` macro simplifies repetitive configuration patterns, by
providing context-sensitive local macros in `setup` bodies.

See [SetupEl][ewiki] on Emacs Wiki for more details and examples.

Installation
------------

`setup.el` is part of [GNU ELPA][elpa], and can be installed using
`package.el`.

Usage
-----

The `setup` macro is autoloaded, and can be used directly.  The code
generated by `setup` does not depend on `setup.el`, meaning that your
initialization file can be byte-compiled more efficiently.

Bugs
----

Bugs or patches can be submitted to my [public inbox][mail].  Note
that non-trivial contributions require a [copyright assignment][ca] to
the FSF.

This package is still young, so wishes, impressions and criticism are
very appreciated. If you have anything to say, feel free to send an
email to the aforementioned [public inbox][mail].
